# BubBlow

The BubBlow project was developed during thesis writing. Specifically, two separate applications were developed, a mobile device app (Android) that aimed to have patients with respiratory problems practice breathing exercises, and a Desktop app (Windows), reserved for physicians, that aimed to monitor data from the mobile device app.
